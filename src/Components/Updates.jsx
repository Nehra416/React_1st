                    In simple words, a component in React.js is like a building block for creating parts of a webpage. It's a piece of code that describes how a part of the user interface (UI) should look and behave. You can think of components as LEGO bricks that you can put together to build a whole webpage. Each component can have its own style, behavior, and data, making it easier to manage and reuse parts of your web application.

            </div>
        </div>
    )
